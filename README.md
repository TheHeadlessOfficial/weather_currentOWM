## **WIKI**<br>

Download the .zip file, extract the files, copy the file `.conkyrc_owmairp` and the folder `.conky` inside your Linux `home`.<br>
If your `home` is named *pippo*, copy inside *pippo* so you get: `/home/pippo/.conky` and `/home/pippo/.conkyrc_moonpy`<br>
Go to `/home/YOURHOMENAME/.conky/AirPollution` and open with a text editor the file `airpollution.py`, go to row 15 and 16 and type your latitude and your longitude, go to row 17 and write your APPID.<br>
If you don't know how to get your APPID, follow this video instructions: [APPID guide](https://youtu.be/FxcR7c3YwEQ?si=ay6RzB4c5vtuZQpF&t=67)
<br>
The python script saves data in files so you can build your conky moon as you wish.<br>
The `.conkyrc_owmairp` file i attach, works.<br>
Run the file `.conkyrc_owmairp` from terminal (the first time you run this conky), so you can get possible errors.
